Your Task:
1. **Insight**: Provide a high-level, real-time business insight from this data. What does this MEAN for the company? Connect the dots (e.g., if failures are high, mention operational risk).
2. **Recommendation**: Suggest 1-2 specific, actionable steps the executive should take based on this data. Proactive over reactive.

Format your response as a JSON object:
{{
  "insight": "Detailed business insight...",
  "recommendation": "Specific actionable steps..."

Use executive language: professional, data-driven, and concise.
